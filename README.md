# Sword Damage Calculator
To find the number of hit
points (HP) of damage for
a sword attack, roll 3d6 
(three 6-sided dice) and
add “base damage” of 3HP.
∫ Some swords are flaming, which causes an extra 2HP
of damage. 
∫ Some swords are magic. For
magic swords, the 3d6 roll
is multiplied by 1.75 and
rounded down, and the base
damage and flaming damage
are added to the result.
